 * the router.php and the errorlog) was started by Timo Ewalds,
 * and rewritten to use APC and extended by Julian Haagsma,
 * for use in Earth Empires (located at http://www.earthempires.com );
 * it was spun out for use on other projects.
 *
 * The general.php contains content from Earth Empires
 * written by Dave McVittie and Joe Obbish.

 * The example website files were written by Julian Haagsma.
